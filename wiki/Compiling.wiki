This project is released under a specific open-source license, which requires that the entire sourcecode should *always* be made available in case of modifications and should *never* be used commercially.

The sourcecode for a specific version is available under the Source tab.


== How to Compile ? ==

First, you will have to download and install the following tools/libraries:

 # from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitPPC here], the last version of DevkitPPC. Windows user should directly run the Automated Installer. During installation, make sure you get libogc and libfat libraries installed as well. They should be installed in C:/devkitpro/libogc/
 # from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/portlibs here], the following libraries: zlib, libpng & libtremor. Make sure you pick the precompiled PPC versions and extract them in C:/devkitpro/portlibs/ppc/. You should have the following directories once extracted:

 * /devkitpro/portlibs/ppc/include

 * /devkitpro/portlibs/ppc/include/tremor

 * /devkitpro/portlibs/ppc/lib

Once you are done, if you haven't one yet, install a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Subversion_clients SVN client] and get the source code of the last version from SVN by using the following command line:
svn checkout http://genplus-gx.googlecode.com/svn/tags/XXXXX
where XXX is the version you want (browse Source tab for more informations)

Finally, run compile_all.bat from the root of source directory.

The DevkitPro download page provides all the precompiled libraries and include files required to compile the current source code of Genesis Plus GX. However, you could also get the current source code of the libraries, compile them yourself and install as specified (generally *make* then *make install*).
