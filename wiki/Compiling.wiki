You might want to compile the sourcecode yourself from SVN for various reasons:

 * to test the current build before it is officially released
 * to compile the sourcecode with libsamplerate BEST convertor (see genplus manual)
 * to implement your own features.

However, I would be grateful if you take the *following points* in consideration:

 * current SVN build should always be considered as unstable and work in progress, you can get it from SVN and compile a binary but don't complain about bugs and don't make public release from this.
 * you can modify the sourcecode as you want but in order to keep this project clean and structured, I would ask you to keep ANY private build for yourself and avoid public or mass-distribution of derivative works. If you think the modification you made should be implemented in an official release, please contact me and I would eventually add them and obviously give all the credits to you.


== Instructions ==

You will need to be familiar with development environment setup. If you don't, you might look at [http://www.wiibrew.org wiibrew] or [http://www.tehskeen.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2968 tehskeen's forum].

First, you will have to download and install the following tools/libraries:

 # the last version of Devkitpro and [https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&package_id=124208 DevkitPPC]. Windows user should directly run the [https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&package_id=160396 AutoInstaller] version
 # the CVS version of [http://devkitpro.cvs.sourceforge.net/devkitpro/libogc/ libogc]. 
 # the last version of [https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&package_id=197264 libfat]. You can also get and compile the current source from [http://devkitpro.cvs.sourceforge.net/devkitpro/libfat/ CVS repository]
 # the last [http://hackmii.com/2008/08/libdi-and-the-dvdx-installer/ libDI] source code.

Once you are done, grab the current [http://code.google.com/p/genplus-gx/source/checkout genplus-gx] source code from SVN then launch compile_all.bat from *msys* (installed with devkitpro)
