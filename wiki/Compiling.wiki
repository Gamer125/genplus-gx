=== Disclaimer ===

You might want to compile the sourcecode yourself from SVN for various reasons:

 * to test the current build before it is officially released
 * to compile the sourcecode with libsamplerate BEST convertor (see genplus manual)
 * to implement your own features.

However, I would be grateful if you take the following points in consideration:

 # current SVN build should always be considered as unstable and work in progress, you can get it from SVN and compile a binary but don't complain about bugs and don't make public release.
 # you can modify the sourcecode as you want but in order to keep this project clean and structured, I would ask you to keep ANY private build for yourself and avoid public or mass-distribution of derivative works. If you think the modification you made should be implemented in an official release, please contact me and I would eventually add them and obviously give all the credits to you.
