= Introduction =

Genesis Plus's compatibility should be quite high, let's say 99.9% of known roms are working, the only unsupported ones being a few unlicensed/pirates games which need unemulated custom cartridge hardware.
I personnaly tested many games to be sure they all work like on original hardware, without any graphical glitches or lockup but feel free to add comments if you found a specific game not running properly with this emulator.

= Non-Working Games =

Mulan (Unl): hangs after title screen
Pocket Monsters II (Unl): hangs on title screen
Super King Kong 99 (Unl): don't boot
Top Fighter 2000 MK VIII (Unl): don't boot
Top Shooter (Unl): no input
Chinese Fighter III (Unl): hangs on character selection screen
Pokemon Stadium (Unl): don't boot
Sonic Jam 6 (Unl): don't boot

= Working Games =

all other games :-)
