== Mega Drive & Genesis games ==

Genesis Plus GX is compatible with 100% of commercial, unlicensed & pirate Mega Drive & Genesis dumped games, which means that all these games have been verified to be working without any graphical glitches or lockup.

Off course, it is impossible for me to test all games *from start to end* so feel free to add comments or fill an issue request if you found a specific game not running properly or accurately with this emulator.

On a side note, make sure you are always using good dumps, ROM files labeled as bad dump ,"fixed" or hacked (b1, f1, h1, ...), generally cause issues (even on real hardware).


== SG-1000, Game Gear, Master System games ==

Genesis Plus GX is able to reproduce accurately the behavior of several console models, which is required to assure 100% compatibility with all SG-1000, Master System & Game Gear released software, including demos and unlicensed games.
