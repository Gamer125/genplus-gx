#summary A list of known non-working games
#labels Featured

Genesis Plus compatibility is now very close to 100%, which means that all known games are working without any graphical glitches or lockup. The only unsupported ones are listed below and probably didn't work on a real Mega Drive either. 


I personally tested many games to be sure they all work like on original hardware, however, it is impossible for me to test all games *from start to end* so feel free to add comments or fill an issue request if you found a specific game not running properly with this emulator.


On a side note, make sure you are always using good dumps, ROM files labeled as bad dump ,"fixed" or hacked (b1, f1, h1, ...), can generally cause issues (even on real hardware).


== Not Working ==

 * Top Shooter (Unl): no input (runs on genesis-like arcade hardware)
 * Sonic Jam 6 (Unl): don't boot (no valid code in ROM, probably a bad dump)


== Working ==

all other games :-)
