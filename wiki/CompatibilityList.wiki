== Mega Drive & Genesis games ==

Genesis Plus GX is compatible with 100% of commercial, unlicensed & pirate Mega Drive & Genesis dumped games, which means that all these games have been verified to be working without any graphical glitches or lockup.

Off course, it is impossible for me to test all games *from start to end* so feel free to add comments or fill an issue request if you found a specific game not running properly or accurately with this emulator.

On a side note, make sure you are always using good dumps, ROM files labeled as bad dump ,"fixed" or hacked (b1, f1, h1, ...), generally cause issues (even on real hardware).


== Master System games ==

Genesis Plus GX compatibility with Master System games should be the same as Power Base Converter compatibility. This means that approximately 95% of the Master System library is running, with a few games having issues because of Genesis lacking features of the original Master System (see below).

In particular, following games are not working correctly with Power Base Converter (and Genesis Plus GX):


==== _games requiring Master System BIOS to initialize VDP registers_ ====
 * California Games II
 * Speed Ball

==== _games requiring extended VDP modes_ ====
 * Cosmic Spacehead
 * Excellent Dizzy Collection, The [Proto]
 * Fantastic Dizzy
 * Micro Machines

==== _games requiring Master System VDP specific features_ ====
 * Bart vs. The Space Mutants (palette issue)
 * Earthworm Jim (zoomed sprites issue)
 * X-Men - Mojo World (palette issue)
 * Y'S (Japanese version only)

==== _games requiring old TMS9918-like VDP modes_ ====
 * Dr Hello
 * F-1 Spirit - The way to Formula-1
 * F16 Fighter
 * F16 Fighting Falcon
 * FA Tetris
 * Flashpoint
 * Loretta no Shouzou - Sherlock Holmes
 * Penguin Adventure
 * Street Master
 * Super Boy II
 * The Three Dragon Story
 * Wonsiin

For similar reasons, Game Gear & SG-1000 games are not supported.
