Genesis Plus's compatibility should be quite high, let's say 99.9% of known roms are working. The only unsupported ones are a few unlicensed/pirates games which require some custom cartridge hardware. 

I personnaly tested many games to be sure they all work like on original hardware, without any graphical glitches or lockup, however, feel free to add comments if you found a specific game not running properly with this emulator.
