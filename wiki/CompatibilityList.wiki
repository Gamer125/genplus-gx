== SG-1000, Game Gear, Master System games ==

Genesis Plus GX is able to reproduce accurately the behavior of several console models, which is required to assure 100% compatibility with all SG-1000, Master System & Game Gear released software, including demos and unlicensed games.

SG-1000 games are compatible with Mark-III and Master System hardware, using backwards compatibility mode (a custom BIOS is required on Game Gear). For correct color palette, use SG-1000 hardware.

Game Gear games are only compatible with Game Gear hardware.

Master System games are compatible with Game Gear and Genesis hardware, using backwards compatibility mode. However, the following games are known to be working only on specific hardware:

==== _games requiring Master System BIOS to initialize VDP registers_ ====
 * California Games II
 * Speed Ball

==== _games incompatible with Genesis VDP_ ====
 * Bart vs. The Space Mutants (palette issue)
 * Earthworm Jim (zoomed sprites issue)
 * X-Men - Mojo World (palette issue)

==== _games requiring legacy VDP modes_ ====

 * Dr Hello
 * F-1 Spirit - The way to Formula-1
 * F16 Fighter
 * F16 Fighting Falcon
 * FA Tetris
 * Flashpoint
 * Loretta no Shouzou - Sherlock Holmes
 * Penguin Adventure
 * Street Master
 * Super Boy II
 * The Three Dragon Story
 * Wonsiin
 * Cyborg Z

==== _games requiring Master System II or Game Gear extended VDP modes_ ====
 * Cosmic Spacehead
 * Excellent Dizzy Collection, The [Proto]
 * Fantastic Dizzy
 * Micro Machines

==== _games requiring Mark III or Master System I VDP limitation_ ====
 * Y'S (Japanese version)



== Mega Drive & Genesis games ==

Genesis Plus GX is compatible with 100% of commercial, unlicensed & pirate Mega Drive & Genesis dumped games, which means that all these games have been verified to be working without any graphical glitches or lockup.

Off course, it is impossible for me to test all games *from start to end* so feel free to add comments or fill an issue request if you found a specific game not running properly or accurately with this emulator.

On a side note, make sure you are always using good dumps, ROM files labeled as bad dump ,"fixed" or hacked (b1, f1, h1, ...), generally cause issues (even on real hardware).
