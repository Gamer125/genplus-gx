Genesis Plus main goal is to provide the most complete & accurate emulation of the Sega Genesis/Megadrive hardware.

The original emulation core from [http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/ Charles Mac Donald] has been slightly modified and emulation bugs tracked down to improve overall accuracy and therefore compatibility, as well as adding emulation of various peripherals and extra hardware.

=== Very Accurate & Full Speed Sega Genesis/Megadrive emulation ===

 * NTSC (60Hz) & PAL (50Hz) hardware emulation
 * highly accurate 68k & Z80 CPU emulation
 * highly accurate VDP emulation (HBLANK, DMA, FIFO, HV interrupts, undocumented registersâ€¦)
 * cycle-accurate YM2612 emulation (FM synthesis is done at the original frequency, using FIR resampling)
 * accurate chip synchronization (68k/Z80 access to YM2612/SN76489)
 * basic hardware latency emulation (VDP/68k, Z80/68k)
 * full overscan area (horizontal & vertical colored borders) emulation
 * full TMSS BIOS support
 * experimental PICO hardware support
 * Blargg's software NTSC filters support
