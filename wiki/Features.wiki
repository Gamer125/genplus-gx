Genesis Plus main goal is to provide the most complete & accurate emulation of the Sega Genesis/Megadrive hardware.

The original emulation core from [http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/ Charles Mac Donald] has been slightly modified and emulation bugs tracked down to improve overall accuracy and therefore compatibility, as well as adding emulation of various peripherals and extra hardware.

=== Very Accurate & Full Speed Sega 8-bit / 16-bit emulation ===

 * Accurate emulation of SG-1000, Mark-III, Master System (I & II), Game Gear, Genesis & Mega Drive hardware models (incl. backwards compatibility modes)
 * NTSC (60Hz) & PAL (50Hz) hardware emulation 
 * highly accurate 68000 & Z80 CPU emulation 
 * highly accurate VDP emulation (Mode 4 & Mode 5, HBLANK, DMA, FIFO, HV interrupts, undocumented registers, mid-line display status changesâ€¦) 
 * cycle-accurate YM2612 & YM2413 emulation (FM synthesis is done at the original frequency, using FIR resampling) 
 * cycle-accurate chip synchronization (68000/Z80/YM2612/SN76489) 
 * basic hardware latency emulation (VDP/68k, Z80/68k) 
 * full overscan area emulation (horizontal & vertical color borders) 
 * internal OS ROM support, including accurate TMSS model emulation
 * Blargg's software NTSC filters support 
 * preliminary PICO emulation
