== Choose a version ==

Gamecube and Wii applications usually come in the form of .dol files.

Once you have downloaded and decompressed the archive, you should get two versions of the emulator:

 * genplus_cube.dol is the version running in Gamecube mode. This can be loaded on a Gamecube or on a Wii using Gamecube compatibility mode.

 * genplus_wii.dol is the version running in Wii mode. This can only be loaded on a Wii. 

  
  
== How to run the emulator ==

=== on the Wii ===

The easiest way to load & run the emulator on the Wii is to install the [http://hbc.hackmii.com/ Homebrew Channel]. Once you are done, simply copy the /apps directory and his content (included in the release) to the root of the SDCARD.

There are other ways to run .dol files on the Wii like building a dedicated channel or using an alternate DOL loader. Feel free to visit http://www.wiibrew.org for additional informations.


=== on the Gamecube ===

There are several [http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Booting_GameCube_Linux methods] to load .dol files on the Gamecube:
 
 * via a SD-adapter and [http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/SDload SDLOAD]
 * via a [http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Building_a_Bootable_Disc bootable disc]
 * via [http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/PSOload streaming]



== How to use the emulator ==

This is a Sega *Genesis/Megadrive* emulator: it requires suitable ROM images in the form of .bin or .smd files but .zip files are also supported (as long as they contain a proper ROM file). Please note that .sms (Master System), .gg (Game Gear), .32x (32 X) or .iso (Mega CD) files are NOT supported.

To play a game, ROM file need to be loaded first: you can either load from a DVD or from SDCARD (on the Gamecube, a SD-adapter is required ). On the Wii, you can also load ROM files from a connected USB device (support for USB 1.0 only, which means slower loading speeds).

Please note that there is a limit of 1000 ROM files per directory so it's strongly advised to create subdirectories, reducing the number of roms per directory also helps improving browsing times.

=== from SD/USB ===

First, make sure your device have at least one partition formatted to FAT (FAT16 or FAT32). Then, you should create a directory named */genplus* at the root of your device. Inside that directory, create another directory named */roms* where you can start copying your ROM files and subdirectories. If the /roms directory does not exist, the program will automatically let you browse from the root of the device. If the */genplus* directory does not exist, it will be automatically created.

=== from DVD ===

First, make sure your DVD is compliant with the ISO9660 format. ROM files can be put anywhere but again, it is better to use subdirectories and keep a limited amount of files in each directory.

Wii users will need to install the [http://hackmii.com/2008/08/libdi-and-the-dvdx-installer/ DI layer interface] first and burn a suitable DVD. Please read the above article carefully to know about the required DVD types. The last version of the DVDX Installer can be found [http://bootmii.org/download/ here].
