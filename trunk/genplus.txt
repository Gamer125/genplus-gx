The emulator is provided as a .dol which is a Gamecube Executable. You only need to load and run
the DOL on your GC or WII (Gamecube controller is needed) using various methods (Bootable DVD, SDLOAD,...)
If you have no idea on how to load&run a DOL, please go here on follow the available guides:
http://modyawii.tehskeen.com/  (Booting Homebrew Section)

SDCARD users should create a directory named "genplus" at the root of the SDCARD.
Inside this directory, you have to create then a subdirectory named "roms" to put all your roms.
You should also create a subdirectory named "saves" where SRAM and FreezeState files will be saved.

If using a DVD to load the roms, the format of the image you burned must be ISO9960
or you won't be able to read from it. The maximal readable size is 1.35GB for Gamecube users
and 4.7GB for Wii users.

IMPORTANT: When putting roms either on DVD or SDCARD, it is recommended to use subdirectories as there is 
	   a limit of 1000 files per directory.

  You'll start off with the main introduction screen and after pressing "A"
  you will be at the main menu. Note that at anytime during gameplay you can
  return to the main menu by tapping on that little Z button (you know, the
  one on your controller).

  Pressing 'L + Z' Triggers during Gameplay will execute a "Soft Reset".
  This should be like pressing the RESET button on a real Genesis.
  This is needed by some games to unlock special features and by the X-Men
  game to complete the "Mojo's Crunch" level.

  Pressing 'B' in any menu will get you back to the previous screen.

  Of course it's a menu so you have yourself a few things to choose from.
  So here's a list and what they do.


  PLAY GAME:   Takes you into or back to the game.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  GAME INFOS:  Shows basic ROM information
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This screen shows some basic information for the loaded ROM.
    Of note is the supports area at the bottom of the list.
    Use Up/Down buttons or Analog Stick to scrolldown the screen.
    If the ROM supports 6-button gamepads, they are automatically selected for you.
    Otherwise, the standard 3-button pad is used. (This can also be forced in Joypad Config menu)

  
  RESET GAME:  Performs a soft-reset on the genesis virtual console
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  LOAD NEW GAME:   Let you load a new game from DVD or SDCARD
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    When entering the rom selection menu (DVD or SDCARD), following controls are used:

	. A button : load the selected file 
	. B button : go up one directory
	. Z button : quit the file selection menu 
	. L/R triggers : go down/up one full page
	. Left/Right buttons or Analog stick : scroll the selected entry's filename when it can't be full displayed
	. Up/Down buttons or Analog stick : select previous/next file

    * Load from DVD:
    ****************

       A DVD browser is displayed. Navigate and select your ROM from here.
       IMPORTANT: Your DVD must be in ISO9660 format

    * Load from SDCARD:
    *******************

       A SDCARD browser is displayed. Navigate and select your ROM from here.
       IMPORTANT: To load roms from SDCARD, you have to use a SDCARD adapter in MC SlotA
		  On the SDCARD, roms must be initially placed in /genplus/roms subdirectory

   In both cases, the maximum number of files per directory (DVD or SDCARD) is 1000.
   It is *recommended* to use subdirectories.


  EMULATOR OPTIONS:  Let you configure various options
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Misc Options:
  *************

    X and Y are to try to compensate for TVs with high overscan, or if
    you just want to play on a smaller area.

    VDP Latency is used to be more accurate in term of VRAM write timing, 
    it is required by some games (Chaos Engine...) to be displayed properly
    (ON by default)

    DMA Timing is used to be more accurate in term of DMA copy to V-RAM timing,
    it is required by some games (Legend of Galahad...) to be displayed properly
    (ON by default)

    ALT. timing let you modify the line rendering timing. This is needed by some games
    (Lotus 2 RECS) to prevent display glitches
    (OFF by default, automatically set when specific rom is detected)

    CPU Mode let you force the CPU speed for the game:
      * AUTO: orignal CPU speed is automatically detected 
      * NTSC: 60hz Genesis display
      * PAL:  50Hz Genesis display
    The game will automatically be be reloaded after you change this setting.

    REGION let you force the region setting for the game:
    when changing region setting, some games may display different things but also may not load
    if they have some internal region detection code.
      * AUTO: orignal game region is automatically detected
      * EUR (europe 50Hz), USA (usa 60Hz), JAPAN (japan 60Hz) or JAPAN_PAL (japan 50Hz)
    The game will automatically be be reloaded after you change this setting.

    SRAM AUTOLOAD let you enable/disable automatic SRAM loading when starting a new game.
    The detection order is: MCARD (SLOTA) > MCARD (SLOTB) > SDCARD (SLOTA) > SDCARD (SLOTB)


  Sound Options:
  **************

    PSG VOLUME let you adjust the global volume level for the PSG output (0~200%)
    FM Volume let you adjust the global volume level for the FM output (0~200%)
    Default values depends on the current FM & PSG core and are automatically set when switching between cores.

    BOOST VOLUME let you modify the overall sound level (0~4x).
    This could be useful when adjusting FM and PSG relative levels.
    Setting those values too high may produce some bad effects.

    HQ YM2612 is only useful when selecting Gens FM core, in order to have the most accurate YM2612 emulation.

    FM CORE let you choose which YM2612 emulation core to use, both have specific issues with some games:
      * GENS is the core used in Gens, a famous Genesis emulator for PC platforms
      * MAME is the one used in MAME (DEFAULT)

    PSG CORE let you choose which PSG emulation core to use:
      * MAME is the one used in MAME
      * SMSP is the one developped by Maxim from smspower.org (DEFAULT)



  Configure Joypads:
  ******************

    Allows you to configure the joypads.
    Here you can remap all 6 buttons, and adjust the Analog stick
    sensitivity. A lower value is more sensitive.
    
	IMPORTANT: the Analog Stick is also used when emulating the Sega Menacer lightgun,
	so you may want to reduce the sensibility when playing the Menacer 6-in-1 game

    
    TYPE let you choose the type of the emulated Genesis gamepads (3-Buttons or 6-Buttons)
    Genesis Plus automatically detects and set this option if the current game supports 6-Buttons but
    you can also force use of 3-Buttons gamepads if you prefer.

	* 3BUTTONS: use classic Genesis controllers
	* 6BUTTONS: use 6-Buttons Genesis controllers 

 
    PORTA and PORTB let you choose which type of device to be plugged in each two Genesis input ports:

	* GAMEPAD: single gamepad (3 or 6-buttons, see above)
	* MULTITAP: multiplayer adapter (Sega Teamplayer or EA 4-Way Play)
	* NONE: unplugged

	IMPORTANT:
	
	1/ MULTITAP should only be plugged if the game is supporting one of the multiplayer adapter.
	   Actually, both Sega Teamplayer and EA 4-Way Play adapters are supported.
	   Games are usually supporting only one of the above adapters but Genesis Plus automatically detect
	   which one should be used.

	3/ Most multiplayer games will work with MULTITAP plugged in PORTA but some of them require
	   a GAMEPAD to be plugged in PORTA and the MULTITAP to be plugged in PORTB.

	4/ MULTITAP shouldn't be plugged in both ports since only games supporting more than 4 players
	   can take advantage of this configuration. As we only have 4 controllers max. on the Gamecube, 
	   only the 4 first gamepads will effectively been seen as plugged.
	 
	5/ J-Cart games (Micromachines games, Pete Sampras games, Super Skidmarks) use a built-in adapter
	   to enable 2 additional gamepads to be plugged and are not compatible with any of the above adapters.
	   So, do not activate MULTITAP with those games, they are automatically detected by the system which
	   configure itself to enable up to 4 players support. 

	6/ Be sure that all controllers are correctly plugged when you switch on the console, otherwise,
	   they won't be detected. Also don't unplug any controllers or you will need to reboot the system.
	
	7/ Changing Controller Type or Port settings will reset the current game.

	8/ When the 6-in-1 Menacer game is detected, PORTA is forced to NONE and PORTB forced to MENACER, you 
	   can not change those settings as long as you don't load another rom (previous settings will be restored)
    


  Game Genie Cheats:
  ******************
  
    Code entry for those of you into cheating :)
    This screen lets you enter up to eight Game Genie codes.
    Use the A key to select/release an entry
    Use the B key to exit.



  MEMORY MANAGER: Let you managed SRAM and FreezeState files
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  . SRAM Manager:  Let you load/save SRAM data from/to the selected device
  . STATE Manager: Let you load/save FreezeState data from/to the selected device

  For each submenu, you can now choose the device type and location.
  Be sure to set this according to your system configuration before saving/loading files.

  . Device: Let you choose the device to use: SDCARD or MCARD
  . SLOT: Let you choose which MC slot to use for the device

  IMPORTANT:
   
   1/ when using NGC Memory Card in SLOTA, some mounting errors may occur. In this case,
      remove and insert the Memory Card again before trying to save/load anything.

   2/ when using SDCARD, the directory /genplus/saves must exist

   3/ for Wii users, please note that the SD slot can *NOT* be acceeded so use a SD-Adapter in a MC SLot
   


  STOP DVD MOTOR:  Stop the DVD motor and the disc from spinning during playtime
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  SYSTEM REBOOT:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For users of SDLoad or PSOLoad, you can call this to go back.
    For others, this will reboot the system

According to the GNU status of this project, the sourcecode MUST be included in any binary releases you made.
To recompile the sourcecode, you will need to have installed:
 . DevkitPPC environment
 . libOGC last sources
 
You also need to replace the gu_psasm.S file which is located in the /LIBBOGC directory (from the root of libogc source directory)
with the one included in this release and then recompile/reinstall libogc.

If you have no idea on how to compile DOLs , please refer to this thread:
http://www.tehskeen.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2968.
